  <h1 class="visuallyhidden">About certified companies</h1>

  <p>A certified company verifies your identity. They’ve all met security standards set by government.</p>

  <p>You don’t need to be an existing customer with a company as they've built new, secure systems to verify identities.</p>

      <p>There won’t be any effect on your credit score.</p>

      <p>Certified companies meet government privacy standards, so you can trust them with your personal information. They won’t share or sell your data for any other purposes without your consent.</p>

      <p>More than one certified company means you choose who verifies your identity, and it means the system overall is stronger.</p>
